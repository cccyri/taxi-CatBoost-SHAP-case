# taxi-CatBoost-SHAP-case
This notebook explores a problem of a taxi startup concerned about the amount of their overpaid claims from the users.\
Here you can find the preprocessing of data, analysis, visualisation, and, finally, a conclusion for the company to adress their issue.\
The notebook uses CatBoost to select the important features for analysis, SHAP to better visualise features and their contributions, and lots of pandas.
